# Sequence Structure — Follow This Exactly

**Generate TWO sequences: (1) Core email + LinkedIn + call sequence, (2) LinkedIn-only sequence.** Use the structure below. Do NOT use a 14-day sequence with multiple LinkedIn message steps in the core flow.

**Output as plain text / narrative markdown** (e.g. "## Step 1: Initial Email (Day 1)" then Subject and Body as paragraphs). Do NOT output a markdown table or use HTML like `<br>` in the copy.

## Core Sequence (Email + LinkedIn + Call)

| Day | Step | Channel | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | Email | Email | Highly personal technical email. Lead with a POV on their current stack/launch. |
| **Day 1** | LinkedIn connection | LinkedIn | Click "Connect" only—no connection request message from GPT. If they accept → add to LinkedIn-only sequence. |
| **Day 1** | Call attempt | Phone | Opener + voicemail if no answer. |
| **Day 3** | Light bump | Email | Same thread. Light bump. |
| **Day 3** | Call attempt | Phone | Opener + voicemail if no answer. |
| **Day 5** | Slightly more robust | Email | Same thread. Still light but slightly more robust. **[Resource / mixed media – add manually]** |
| **Day 5** | Call attempt | Phone | Opener + voicemail if no answer. |
| **Day 8** | New thread, value | Email | **New email thread.** Pick up on a new or nuanced topic aimed at providing value. |
| **Day 9** | Call attempt | Phone | Opener + voicemail if no answer. |
| **Day 11** | Lighter + resource | Email | Same thread as Day 8. Lighter email. Direct toward website or **[resource – add manually, not same as Day 5]** |
| **Day 12** | Call attempt | Phone | Opener + voicemail if no answer. |
| **Day 15** | Breakup | Email | Kind breakup. "Sounds like timing might not be right… you know where to find me! Hope we connect down the line." |

**Rules:** Same thread for Day 1–5; new thread for Day 8 onward. Only one LinkedIn step in core (Day 1 connect). Call steps on Day 1, 3, 5, 9, 12—opener + voicemail only; no long scripts needed.

## LinkedIn Only Sequence

Generate this in full so the user can run it when the prospect accepts the connection. No call steps in LinkedIn-only.

| Day | Step | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | Core message | "Hey [Name], great to be connected! Noticed/reaching out because..." |
| **Day 3** | Bump + CTA | Similar but slightly nuanced. Include CTA. |
| **Day 5** | Super light bump | "Circling back here..." |
| **Day 9** | Super light touch | More of a statement than a question. Or: "Any thoughts, [Name]?" |

## Call Step Format

For each call step: provide a brief **opener** and **voicemail** (if no answer). Keep it short—no need for full scripts; user uses prior emails as reference on the call.

## Outreach.io CSV

When exporting: step_number, step_day, step_type (Email/LinkedIn/Phone), subject, body. Core sequence has 12 steps (Days 1 email, 1 LinkedIn, 1 call, 3 email, 3 call, 5 email, 5 call, 8 email, 9 call, 11 email, 12 call, 15 breakup).
