# Pivot 2: Research Input Worksheet

Fill this in with what you **actually** gather when you research a company manually (before writing a hypothesis or sequence). Your answers will become the new section names and prompts in the app.

## 1. What do you look for first?

When you open a company’s profile or site, what’s the first thing you try to find?

- [ ] Company size / headcount / engineering size  
- [ ] What they do / product / industry  
- [ ] Recent news (funding, launch, hiring)  
- [ ] Tech stack / tools they use  
- [ ] Job postings (which roles, which teams)  
- [ ] Who to contact (names, titles, LinkedIn)  
- [ ] Other: _____________________

**In one sentence:** What’s the first thing you want to know?  
*(e.g. “Why now—what’s the trigger that makes this the right time to reach out?”)*

---

## 2. What do you paste or note for “company fit”?

When you’re deciding “is this a good account for Cursor?”, what do you actually copy or write down?

- Bullets or a short list of what you capture:
  - 
  - 
  - 

**What would you name this section?** (e.g. “Company / ICP fit”, “Why this account”, “Account fit”)  
**What 1–2 sentence instruction would help someone (or you) paste the right thing?**  
*(e.g. “Paste 2–3 sentences on company size, engineering headcount, and why they’re a fit for Cursor.”)*

---

## 3. What do you use for “why now” / trigger?

When you’re looking for a reason to reach out *now* (launch, hiring, funding, etc.), what do you look at and what do you paste?

- Where you look: *(e.g. company blog, LinkedIn, news, job board)*
- What you copy or note:
  - 

**Section name:** (e.g. “Why now”, “Trigger / timing”, “Recent signals”)  
**1–2 sentence instruction for this section:**

---

## 4. What do you use for “who to contact” / people?

When you’re finding names and titles (VP Eng, DevEx lead, etc.), what do you actually gather?

- Where you look: *(e.g. LinkedIn, Apollo, company page)*
- What you paste or note: *(e.g. name, title, 1 line from profile or post)*

**Section name:** (e.g. “People / roles”, “Target personas”, “Who to contact”)  
**1–2 sentence instruction for this section:**

---

## 5. What do you use for “proof points” or “things I can reference”?

When you want something concrete to cite in an email (e.g. “saw your Platform Engineering role”, “congrats on the Series C”), what do you pull in?

- Where you look:
- What you copy or note:

**Section name:** (e.g. “Proof points”, “Signals to reference”, “Evidence”)  
**1–2 sentence instruction for this section:**

---

## 6. Anything else?

- Do you have a 5th (or 6th) category you always use? *(e.g. “Competitive context”, “Risks”, “Tech stack”)*  
  - Name:  
  - What you paste:  
  - 1–2 sentence instruction:  

- Anything you **don’t** use from the current four sections (Company Overview, Job Postings, LinkedIn Profiles, News/Signals)?  
  - *(e.g. “I rarely use News/Signals as its own section”)*  

---

## 7. Current vs. proposed

| Current section    | Keep? (Y/N) | Rename to?        | Your 1–2 sentence instruction |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Company Overview   |             |                    |                                |
| Job Postings       |             |                    |                                |
| LinkedIn Profiles  |             |                    |                                |
| Recent News/Signals|             |                    |                                |

*(Add rows for any new sections you want.)*

Once this is filled in, we’ll:
1. Update the Research Input UI (section labels + placeholders from your instructions).
2. Update the hypothesis prompt to use the new section names and purpose.
3. Keep the same four (or five) data fields under the hood so hypothesis/sequence logic doesn’t break.

You can fill this in directly in the file, or paste your answers in chat and I’ll turn them into the new sections and prompts.
