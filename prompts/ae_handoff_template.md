# AE Handoff Note Template

Use this structure when generating an AE handoff note from the hypothesis. Fill each section using only information from the hypothesis. Match the tone and depth of the example below.

---

## Structure

**To:** Account Executive  
**From:** Account Associate  
**Account:** [Company name] ([Tier if known, e.g. Tier 1 Enterprise])

### The "Why Now" (The Wedge)
[2–4 sentences. Summarize the timely signals from the hypothesis that make this the right moment to reach out. Lead with the single strongest "wedge" (e.g. platform expansion, AI investment, hiring surge). Be specific—reference concrete details from the hypothesis (e.g. "12 new APIs," "Canva Extend conference").]

### Account Context & Fit
[3–5 bullets. Pull from "Why This Account" and relevant "Why Now" details. Include:]
- **Scale:** [Headcount, engineering size, revenue/funding stage if mentioned.]
- **Tooling philosophy / culture:** [Build vs. buy, platform culture, DX priorities—whatever the hypothesis states.]
- **Other differentiators:** [Tech stack, marketplace scale, strategic bets—anything that shows fit for Cursor.]

### The Pain Points
[3–5 bullets. Translate hypothesis "Why Now" and "Why This Account" into explicit pains. Use the prospect’s language where possible (e.g. "manual toil," "complexity debt"). Each bullet = one pain the AE can explore.]

### Recommended Discovery Question
[One open-ended question the AE can use to open the first call. It should tie together the wedge + one or two pain points. Use second person ("You’ve…" / "How are you…"). Keep it to 1–2 sentences.]

## Example (Canva)

**To:** Account Executive  
**From:** Account Associate  
**Account:** Canva (Tier 1 Enterprise)

### The "Why Now" (The Wedge)
Canva is currently in an aggressive "platform-ization" phase, recently rolling out 12 new APIs and launching the "Canva Extend" developer conference. This expansion significantly increases their internal development complexity. Simultaneously, they've positioned "AI as a core platform layer," creating an immediate internal need for AI-native development tools to manage this evolving codebase.

### Account Context & Fit
- **Scale:** 5,000+ FTEs / 500+ Developers. Their marketplace (300+ apps) has reached 1B+ uses, putting them at a massive enterprise scale.
- **Tooling Philosophy:** They have an explicit "modern platform culture" focused on pragmatic build-vs-buy decisions. They prefer "best-in-class" external solutions over diverting internal resources to replicate tools.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** Leadership prioritizes tools that "spark joy" and eliminate "manual toil."

### The Pain Points
- **Complexity Debt:** Managing larger codebases and 12+ new APIs is slowing down engineering velocity.
- **Onboarding Friction:** High growth and recent hiring for "Platform" and "Infrastructure" roles mean they need to accelerate how quickly new talent understands their intricate systems.
- **AI Implementation:** They are building AI-powered workflows (Design Editing/Content Query) and need a tool that natively understands code better than traditional editors.

### Recommended Discovery Question
"You've recently rolled out 12 new APIs and stated that AI is now a core platform layer at Canva. As your codebase grows in complexity to support this, how are you ensuring your engineers don't lose velocity to 'manual toil' and friction?"
