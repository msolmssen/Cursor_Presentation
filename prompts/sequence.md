## Account Context
{{hypothesis}}

## Sequence Template
{{sequence_template}}

## Cursor Context
{{cursor_context}}

## Your Task

Generate a complete outbound sequence following the template structure. For each touchpoint, create:

### Email Steps
- **Subject Line**: Compelling, personalized subject (under 50 characters)
- **Body**: Concise email (under 150 words) that:
  - Opens with a relevant, researched hook
  - Connects to a specific pain point
  - Offers clear value tied to Cursor
  - Has a soft, low-friction CTA

### LinkedIn Steps
- **Connection Request**: Brief, personalized note (under 300 characters)
- **Follow-up Message**: Conversational message building on the connection

### Call Steps
- **Opener**: 15-second intro that earns the right to continue
- **Talk Track**: Key points to cover if they engage
- **Voicemail**: 30-second script if no answer

## Guidelines

1. **Personalization**: Every touchpoint should reference specific research
2. **Value-First**: Lead with insights, not product pitches
3. **Progression**: Each step should build on the previous
4. **Variety**: Mix channels and approaches across the sequence
5. **Brevity**: Respect their time - keep everything concise

## Output Format

Provide each step with clear labels and ready-to-use copy. Include notes on timing between steps.
