# First Call Agenda Template

Use this structure for the AE's first call. **Fill from hypothesis:** the "Reinforce Hypothesis" block (Section 1), company name in examples, and any lookalike story (Section 3) when the hypothesis mentions a peer/customer. Everything else stays as written unless the hypothesis suggests a tweak.

## 1. Intros & Priorities: The Strategic Calibration

### The Setup
"Both time and resourcing are precious, and in the engineering world, 'shipping fast' vs. 'shipping right' is the constant tug-of-war. To make this time worthwhile, I want to focus on the technical mandates currently on your plate."

### Reinforce Hypothesis
**[Fill from hypothesis: 2–3 sentences that mirror "Why Now" + one key pain. Use their language. End with "But I don't want to assume..." Example below.]**

*Example (Canva):* "I noticed your team recently rolled out 12 new APIs and stated that AI is now a core platform layer at Canva. This led me to believe you're likely focused on accelerating that 'Platform-ization' without drowning the team in complexity debt. But I don't want to assume..."

### The "Company Goal" Question
"If you were to distill the top 1–2 mandates coming from your CTO or CEO right now—whether it's accelerating the move to an AI-native ecosystem or just improving overall ship velocity—what would they be?"

### The Functional KPI & Workstreams
**The Mandate:** "How has that high-level goal impacted your team's mandate? For example, are you being measured on Time-to-First-PR for new hires or overall Feature Velocity?"

**The Leverage:** "When you think about the biggest points of leverage to hit those metrics, is it adding more headcount, or is it fundamentally changing the fidelity of the tools your current [N] devs are using?"

### AI Strategy (The "Native" Shift)
**Implementation:** "How has the team been moving beyond generic LLM chat and into AI-native development? Most teams have tried extensions like Copilot but are finding they lack the deep codebase context needed for complex architecture like yours. What has your experience been?"

**Structure:** "Is your AI strategy being driven top-down as a 'Platform' requirement, or is it bubbling up from individual engineers looking for better ways to handle the complexity of your evolving [API/product] ecosystem?"

## 2. Cursor Overview: The Talking Points

Focus on the "Why Cursor" theses we've built.

- **IDE-Native vs. Extension:** Explain that because Cursor is the editor (not just a plugin), it sees the "Dark Matter" of the codebase that extensions are blind to.
- **Permanent Indexing:** Mention how Cursor builds a mathematical map of the entire project to prevent "hallucinations" that happen when an AI codes in a vacuum.
- **Model Neutrality:** Highlight that they aren't locked into one provider; they get the best model (Claude, GPT, or Cursor-native) for the task at hand.
- **The "Joy" Factor:** Reference their own goal of "eliminating friction" and how Cursor acts as a force multiplier for their most senior engineers.

## 3. Live Demo: High-Value Storytelling

Focus on the "Aha!" moments.

- **The "Contextual Search":** Show @codebase to answer a complex question about a distant utility file—mirroring the challenge of their [new platform/API/product] ecosystem.
- **The "Composer" Moment:** Demonstrate a multi-file edit (e.g., updating a protocol and seeing the change propagate) to show how we eliminate "manual toil."
- **The Lookalike Story:** **[Fill from hypothesis if a peer/lookalike is mentioned; otherwise use a generic example.]** "We recently worked with a peer in [vertical] who was struggling with a similar [challenge]. By using Cursor's extended context, they [outcome]."

## 4. Pricing & Next Steps

- **The "Security" Hook:** "Usually, for a team of your scale, the next step is a deep dive with your Security/Infra leads to review our SOC 2 Type II and 'Privacy Mode' protocols."
- **The Pilot:** "Does it make sense to set up a technical workshop for your [Platform Engineering / relevant] leads next week?"
