## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Firmographic Criteria

| Attribute | Ideal | Good Fit | Not a Fit |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Company Size** | 5,000+ FTEs | 1,000-5,000 FTEs | <500 FTEs |
| **Engineering Headcount** | 500+ developers | 100-500 developers | <50 developers |
| **Revenue** | $500M+ | $100M-500M | <$50M |
| **Funding Stage** | Series C+ or Public | Series B | Pre-seed/Seed |

### Technographic Signals
- Modern tech stack (cloud-native, microservices)
- Large, complex codebases (monorepos, multiple languages)
- Already using VS Code widely
- Investing in developer tooling (CI/CD, testing, observability)
- Platform engineering or DevEx function exists

### Industry Sweet Spots
1. **FinTech** - Fast-moving, engineering-heavy, compliance-aware
2. **E-commerce/Retail Tech** - Scale challenges, time-to-market pressure
3. **SaaS/B2B Software** - Large engineering orgs, ship velocity matters
4. **Healthcare Tech** - Complex systems, security-conscious, modernizing legacy
5. **Enterprise Software** - Large codebases, developer productivity critical

### Disqualifying Factors
- Heavily restricted environments with no external tool approval
- Predominantly non-coding technical work
- Very small, stable codebases with no growth
- Strong existing commitment to competitor (multi-year contracts)

## Buying Signals & Triggers

### Strong Signals (High Intent)

| Signal | Where to Find | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Job posting: "Developer Productivity" or "DevEx"** | LinkedIn, company careers | Dedicated investment in developer tooling |
| **Hiring surge in engineering** | LinkedIn, press releases | Scaling challenges, need productivity tools |
| **Platform engineering team formation** | LinkedIn, blog posts | Formalizing DevEx function |
| **Recent large funding round** | Crunchbase, news | Budget available for tooling investments |
| **Engineering leadership change** | LinkedIn, press | New leader often brings new tools |

### Medium Signals (Awareness/Evaluation)

| Signal | Where to Find | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Blog posts about AI in development** | Company blog, Medium | Thinking about AI coding tools |
| **Mentions of velocity or shipping speed** | Earnings calls, interviews | Pain point we solve |
| **GitHub Copilot mentioned in job posts** | Job listings | Already using AI tools, open to better |
| **Tech stack modernization** | Job posts, tech blog | Investing in developer experience |
| **Developer conference sponsorship** | Events | Cares about developer community |

### Weak Signals (Future Opportunity)

| Signal | Where to Find | Why It Matters |

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. GitHub Copilot

**When to Compete:**
- Prospect already using Copilot but not satisfied
- Concerns about codebase context and accuracy
- Want more than just autocomplete

**Key Differentiators:**
| Cursor | GitHub Copilot |
|--------|----------------|
| Full codebase indexing and context | Limited context window |
| AI chat with project understanding | Chat exists but limited context |
| Built as AI-native editor | Plugin added to VS Code |
| Privacy mode available | Code used for model training (opt-out available) |

**Winning Message:**
"Copilot is autocomplete. Cursor understands your entire codebase. When you ask a question about your code, Cursor can actually answer it."

**Proof Points:**
- Side-by-side accuracy comparisons
- Customer quotes about switching from Copilot
- Specific use cases where context matters

---

### vs. Tabnine

**When to Compete:**
- Privacy/security-conscious organizations
- Enterprise deployment requirements

**Key Differentiators:**
| Cursor | Tabnine |
|--------|---------|
| State-of-the-art AI models | Smaller, older models |
| Full editor experience | Autocomplete only |
| Codebase chat and understanding | Limited AI capabilities |
| Rapid innovation pace | Slower feature development |

**Winning Message:**
"Tabnine was built for a different era. Cursor represents what AI coding tools can be today."

---

### vs. "Build Our Own" / Internal Tools

**When to Compete:**
- Platform teams considering building AI tooling
- Companies with strong "build vs. buy" culture

**Key Differentiators:**
- Cursor has 100+ engineers focused solely on AI coding
- Constant model improvements and new capabilities
- Building an AI editor is a massive undertaking
- Time to value: days vs. months/years

**Winning Message:**
"Your platform team could spend 2 years building 10% of what Cursor does today. Or they could focus on your core product while giving developers the best AI tools available."

---

## Objection Handling Framework

### "We already use GitHub Copilot"

**Acknowledge:** "Great - you've already seen the value of AI coding tools."

**Pivot:** "What we hear from teams using Copilot is that it's great for autocomplete, but struggles with larger context. When you need to understand how your authentication system works across 50 files, or refactor a module without breaking dependencies, that's where codebase understanding matters."

**Offer:** "Would it be useful to see a side-by-side comparison on your actual codebase? Many teams run both for a sprint and the difference becomes clear."

---

### "Security is a concern with AI tools"

**Acknowledge:** "Absolutely - we hear this from most enterprise security teams."

**Address Directly:**
- "Privacy mode ensures your code is never stored or used for model training"
- "We're SOC 2 Type II certified"
- "We can provide our security whitepaper, penetration test results, and connect you with our security team"
- "We have customers in healthcare, financial services, and government who've passed rigorous security reviews"

**Offer:** "Would it help to connect your security team directly with ours? We can walk through our architecture and controls."

---

### "We don't have budget for this"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand - every investment needs to be justified."

**Reframe as ROI:**
- "If your developers save just 1 hour per day, that's 250+ hours per year per developer"
- "At $150k average loaded cost, that's $18k+ value per developer annually"
- "Cursor costs ~$20/developer/month - the math works even with modest productivity gains"

**Offer:** "Could we run a pilot with a small team and measure actual impact? That gives you real data for the business case."

---

### "We need to evaluate first"

**Acknowledge:** "Of course - this is an important decision."

**Structure the Evaluation:**
- "What would make this evaluation successful?"
- "Which teams should be included?"
- "What metrics matter most to you?"
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"

**Offer:** "We've helped many companies run structured evaluations. I can share an evaluation framework that's worked well, and we can set up check-ins to answer questions as they come up."

---

### "My developers should decide / bottom-up adoption"

**Acknowledge:** "Developer choice is important - they're the ones using these tools daily."

**Add Context:**
- "What we've seen work well is leadership enabling the evaluation - making it easy for developers to try Cursor and share feedback"
- "Without that, adoption often stalls due to procurement friction"
- "We can support both: individual trials plus a structured evaluation"

**Offer:** "Would it help to get a few developers started with trials while we discuss what a broader rollout might look like?"

---

## Outreach Messaging Guidelines

### Subject Line Principles
- Reference specific signal or trigger
- Avoid generic "AI coding" language
- Keep under 50 characters
- Examples:
  - "Your DevEx posting caught my attention"
  - "Saw your engineering blog on velocity"
  - "Quick question about your platform team"

### Email Body Principles
- Lead with the signal/trigger (why you're reaching out now)
- Connect to a specific pain point
- Be concise: 3-4 sentences max for cold email
- Clear, low-commitment CTA
- No attachments or links in first touch

### Multi-Threading Strategy
- Start with technical champion (DevEx, Platform Lead)
- Expand to engineering leadership (VP/Director)
- Bring in security early if it's a known concern
- Economic buyer (CTO) engaged when evaluation is serious

### Sequence Timing
- 3-4 touches per week (multi-channel)
- 3-week total sequence duration
- Mix email, LinkedIn, and phone
- Personalization decreases over sequence (front-load it)
