# The Max Solmssen Voice Engine

## Structural DNA
- **The "Two-Paragraph" Rule**: Keep the body to two concise paragraphs. Paragraph 1 = The Signal/Observation. Paragraph 2 = The Peer Insight/Lookalike Story.
- **The "Softener" Lead**: Start with "Curious how...", "I was thinking about...", or "Not sure if you're familiar..."
- **POV Over Pitch**: Take a distinct stance (e.g., "Fine-tuning is a dead end") rather than listing features.
- **Human Post-Scripts (P.S.)**: Use P.S. for personal touches (sports, local news, something from their LinkedIn that caught your eye) to prove you aren't a bot. **P.S. lines are usually manual**—add them yourself when something on their profile catches your eye. Leave a placeholder `[P.S. - add manually if something on their profile resonates]` in generated copy, or omit P.S. if nothing fits.

## Vocabulary & Phrasing (Literal Extracts)
- **Approved Openers**: "Congratulations on the [Launch]—it's clearly a massive step for...", "Appreciated your candor on the phone...", "Just bumping my last note in case it got buried!"
- **The "Peer" Bridge**: "My team at Cursor is supporting [Company]'s developers as they navigate a similar [Technical Problem]..."
- **The CTA Library**:
  - "Up for finding 30 mins to chat next week?"
  - "Interested in taking a look sometime this week?"
  - "Worth a look?"
  - "Does that sound reasonable and worth passing along?"

## Subject Lines
- **Keep short and sweet.** Directly map to the content of the email—simple tagline around the core of the message.
- **Reference competitor companies we're working with** when relevant (e.g., "coinbase's developer velocity strategy").
- **All lowercase letters** in subject lines.
- **NOTHING SALESY.** No hype, no "quick question," no generic outreach language.
- **Examples**: "coinbase's developer velocity strategy" | "better understanding your monolith" | "new cursor feature!"

## Breakup Rules
- **Email breakup**: Short and sweet. Acknowledge timing, leave door open, one light takeaway.
  - **Example**: "Hey [Name], sounds like the timing might not be right here – can only imagine you're crazy busy. If you're ever interested in seeing Cursor in action, you know where to find me! Hope we get the chance to connect down the line..."
- **LinkedIn breakup**: Just a simple sign-off.
  - **Example**: "Any thoughts, [Name]?"

## Tone Constraints
- **NO**: "I'd love to partner with you," "revolutionary," "best-in-class," "hope this finds you well."
- **YES**: "Extraordinarily productive," "high-fidelity tools," "cognitive context-switching," "ground truth."
