# Persona Lanes

Use these lanes to generate scalable sequences (1–3 at a time) that you can run across many prospects in each bucket. Each lane has a **Hook** (what they care about) and a **Cursor play** (how to position Cursor).

**Note:** This file is **audience/angle guidance only**. The app uses it to orient who you're talking to and what they care about. Your other KB files (voice, offers, cursor_encyclopedia, sequence_patterns, personalization) remain the **primary source** for wording, Cursor-specific claims, and style—they take precedence over anything here. Refine those for sharper messaging; use this file to point each lane in the right direction.

## 1. Big Picture Leaders

**Example titles:** VP of Engineering, CTO

**Hook:** How do we ship faster without just hiring more people?

**Cursor play:** Position Cursor as a "force multiplier." If you have 1,000 engineers, even a 5% speed boost is like getting 50 extra developers for free.

## 2. Internal Tool Owners

**Example titles:** Head of Platform, Head of Developer Experience (DX)

**Hook:** Our current tools (like Copilot) are too shallow for our complex codebase.

**Cursor play:** Focus on Depth. Cursor doesn't just "guess" code; it understands the company's specific libraries and internal APIs because it indexes the whole thing.

---

## 3. AI Strategy Leads

**Example titles:** (Newer, high-growth lane) Tasked by the CEO to "incorporate AI" into the company.

**Hook:** We need our engineers to be "AI-Native" to build AI products.

**Cursor play:** Use their own mandate. If they want to be an "AI-First" company, they can't have their engineers using "AI-Second" tools.

---

## 4. Security

**Example titles:** AppSec, CISO, Security Engineers

**Hook:** How do we give our devs AI power without risking our proprietary code?

**Cursor play:** Lead with Privacy. Mention "Privacy Mode" and SOC 2 compliance immediately. They need to know the code stays in their "walled garden."

---

## 5. Power Users

**Example titles:** Staff Engineers, Team Leads, Engineering Directors/Managers (end users)

**Hook:** Stop wasting half your day looking for where a function is defined.

**Cursor play:** Focus on Flow. Show how @codebase or Composer handles the boring, repetitive parts of coding so they can focus on the hard architecture problems.

---

## 6. Product Leaders & Managers

**Example titles:** Product leaders who own the roadmap; often the secret "Economic Buyers."

**Hook:** How do we shorten the distance between a product idea and a shipped feature?

**Cursor play:** Focus on Predictability. In a massive codebase, features often get delayed because engineers spend days "discovery mapping" how to integrate new code. Cursor shrinks that discovery phase, so the Product team gets more predictable release cycles and fewer "this is more complex than we thought" conversations.

**Peer pivot:** Don't talk about syntax or auto-complete. Talk about Cycle Time. When engineers use an AI-native tool that understands the whole codebase, they spend less time on "plumbing" and more time building the user-facing features the Product team cares about.
