# Knowledge Base (KB) Files

This directory contains your writing voice, style, and strategy guidance that the AI uses to generate sequences that sound like YOU.

## Files Overview

- **`cursor_encyclopedia.md`** - Cursor-specific technical theses, product features, and competitive messaging (supplemental context)
- **`voice.md`** - Your writing DNA: tone, style, vocabulary, formatting rules, and gold standard examples
- **`offers.md`** - Your offer library: persona-to-offer map, primary pains, and "Max" offers
- **`sequence_patterns.md`** - Sequence structure, timing, channel mix, and progression rules
- **`personalization_playbook.md`** - Signal-to-message playbook: what personalization is allowed, examples by signal type
- **`persona_lanes.md`** - Persona buckets for scalable sequences: hook + Cursor play per lane (Big Picture Leaders, Internal Tool Owners, Security, etc.). Used by the Sequence Builder to generate 1–3 sequences you can run across many prospects.
- **`reference_customers.md`** - List of current customers (similar accounts) to reference in sequences. The app weaves 1–2 of these into email or LinkedIn steps. If you also paste references in the Research Input field for a specific account, that is used instead; otherwise this file is used.

## How to Use

1. **Fill in the template files** - Each file has placeholders (marked with `[Example: ...]` or `<!-- ... -->`) that you should replace with your actual content
2. **Add real examples** - Paste your best-performing emails, CTAs, and personalization examples
3. **Be specific** - The more specific you are, the better the AI can match your voice
4. **Update regularly** - As you learn what works, update these files

## Manual Work Required

This is the "manual work" part - you'll need to:

1. **Collect your best emails** (10-20 examples)
2. **Extract patterns** (what works, what doesn't)
3. **Fill in the templates** (replace placeholders with your actual content)
4. **Add examples** (paste real emails that worked)

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours for a thorough first pass, then ongoing updates as you learn.

## Integration

Once you've filled these in, the app will automatically load them and inject them into prompts when generating sequences. The AI will use your voice, offers, and patterns to create sequences that match your style.
