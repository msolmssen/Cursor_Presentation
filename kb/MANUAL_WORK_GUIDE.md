# Knowledge Base Manual Work Guide

This guide walks you through the manual work needed to populate your knowledge base files. This is the "manual work" part that will make your sequences sound like YOU.

## Time Estimate
- **First pass**: 2-3 hours
- **Ongoing updates**: 15-30 minutes per week as you learn what works

---

## Step 1: Collect Your Best Emails (30 minutes)

### What to Gather
1. **Your 10-20 best-performing emails** that got responses
   - Look in your email client, Outreach, or CRM
   - Focus on emails that got replies, meetings, or positive engagement
   
2. **A few examples of emails that didn't work** (for contrast)
   - Helps identify what to avoid

3. **Your best CTAs** that got responses
   - Copy/paste the exact CTA text

4. **Your best subject lines** that got opens
   - Copy/paste the exact subject lines

### Where to Find Them
- Your email client (sent folder, search by replies)
- Outreach.io sequences (look at open/reply rates)
- CRM notes (emails that led to meetings)
- Your own notes/documentation

---

## Step 2: Extract Patterns (45 minutes)

### For Each Email, Ask:
1. **What made it work?**
   - Specific research signal referenced?
   - Particular pain point mentioned?
   - Unique angle or offer?
   - Tone/style that resonated?

2. **What's the structure?**
   - How does it open?
   - How many sentences?
   - What's the CTA?

3. **What language patterns do you see?**
   - Words you consistently use
   - Phrases that work
   - Sentence length/style

### Create Lists
- **DO list**: Things that work (10-20 items)
- **DON'T list**: Things that don't work (10-20 items)
- **Best lines**: Your most effective sentences/phrases (10-15 items)

---

## Step 3: Fill in `voice.md` (60 minutes)

### Start Here (Highest Impact)
This file has the biggest impact on making sequences sound like you.

### For Each Section:

**Tone & Personality**
- Look at your best emails - what's the overall vibe?
- Are you direct? Warm? Technical? Conversational?
- Write 2-3 sentences describing your voice

**Vocabulary Preferences**
- Scan your best emails for words you use consistently
- List 5-10 words/phrases you prefer
- List 5-10 words/phrases you avoid (or that don't work)

**Email Structure Rules**
- How do your best emails open? (paste examples)
- What patterns work? (e.g., "Start with specific observation")
- What patterns fail? (e.g., "Don't start with 'I hope this email...'")

**CTAs**
- Copy/paste your 3-5 best-performing CTAs
- Note why each works
- Identify the pattern (e.g., "Question format, time-boxed")

**Gold Standard Examples**
- Paste 3-5 of your absolute best emails
- For each, write 2-3 bullets on why it worked
- This gives the AI concrete examples to pattern-match

### Tips
- **Be specific**: "Start with a job posting quote" is better than "Be personal"
- **Use examples**: Paste real emails, don't just describe
- **Note what doesn't work**: This is as valuable as what does

---

## Step 4: Fill in `offers.md` (30 minutes)

### Identify Your Offers
Think about what you actually offer in outbound:
- Codebase audit?
- Velocity benchmark?
- 15-minute demo?
- Case study?
- Free trial?
- Something else?

### For Each Offer, Document:
1. **What it is** (1-2 sentences)
2. **When to use it** (triggers: e.g., "When they mention onboarding")
3. **Proof points needed** (what you need to make it credible)
4. **Best CTA** (the exact CTA that works with this offer)
5. **Risk level** (Low/Medium/High - how much commitment?)
6. **Example** (paste a real email where you used it)

### If You Don't Have Multiple Offers
That's fine! Just document your default offer (e.g., "15-minute demo") and when you use it.

---

## Step 5: Fill in `sequence_patterns.md` (30 minutes)

### Document Your Sequence Structure
Look at your actual sequences (in Outreach or your email client):

1. **How long are your sequences?** (e.g., 14 days, 8 steps)
2. **What's the channel mix?** (Email/LinkedIn/Phone ratio)
3. **What happens at each step?** (Day 1: initial email, Day 2: LinkedIn, etc.)

### For Each Step, Define:
- **Purpose**: What's this step trying to accomplish?
- **Tone**: How should it sound?
- **Content Rules**: What must/should/can't be included?

### Document Timing
- How many days between steps?
- Best days of week for email/phone?
- When do you use each channel?

### Document Progression
- How does content change across the sequence?
- How does personalization change?
- How do CTAs progress?

---

## Step 6: Fill in `personalization_playbook.md` (30 minutes)

### Define What's Allowed
Look at your best emails - what personalization did you use?

**For Each Type:**
- **Job Postings**: How do you reference them? (paste examples)
- **Company News**: How do you mention it? (paste examples)
- **Tech Stack**: How do you reference it? (paste examples)
- **LinkedIn Info**: What do you use? (paste examples)

### Define What's Off-Limits
- What assumptions have backfired?
- What personalization felt inauthentic?
- What details are too risky to guess?

### Document Softening Language
- How do you make claims feel authentic?
- What phrases do you use? (e.g., "Looks like..." instead of "You are...")
- Paste examples of good vs. bad personalization

---

## Step 7: Review & Refine (15 minutes)

### Quality Check
Go through each file and ask:
- ✅ Is this specific enough? (Replace vague descriptions with examples)
- ✅ Are there real examples? (Paste actual emails, don't just describe)
- ✅ Is this actionable? (Can the AI actually use this?)
- ✅ Does this reflect what actually works? (Not what you think should work)

### Test It
After filling in the files:
1. Generate a test sequence
2. Does it sound like you?
3. If not, what's missing? Go back and add it.

---

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Weekly (15 minutes)
- After sending sequences, note what worked
- Update KB files with new examples
- Add to "DO" lists, remove from "DON'T" lists

### Monthly (30 minutes)
- Review your best-performing sequences
- Extract new patterns
- Update gold standard examples

### Quarterly (1 hour)
- Full review of all KB files
- Remove outdated examples
- Update with latest learnings

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with `voice.md`** - It has the biggest impact
2. **Use real examples** - Paste actual emails, don't just describe
3. **Be specific** - "Start with a job posting quote" > "Be personal"
4. **Note what doesn't work** - This is as valuable as what does
5. **Don't overthink it** - You can always update later
6. **Test and iterate** - Generate sequences, see what works, refine

---

## What "Done" Looks Like

You're done when:
- ✅ `voice.md` has 3-5 real email examples
- ✅ `offers.md` documents your actual offers
- ✅ `sequence_patterns.md` matches your real sequence structure
- ✅ `personalization_playbook.md` has examples of good personalization
- ✅ Generated sequences sound recognizably like you

**You don't need to fill in every single placeholder** - focus on the sections that matter most to your style.

## Questions?

If you're stuck on a section:
- **Skip it for now** - You can always come back
- **Start with examples** - Paste real emails first, then extract patterns
- **Be honest** - Document what actually works, not what you think should work

The goal is to capture YOUR voice, not a generic "best practices" voice. The more authentic, the better.
